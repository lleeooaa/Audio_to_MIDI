# Audio_to_MIDI
A tool that helps convert audio into polyphonic MIDI notes. There are two modes: "vocal" means music with voices and "non_vocal" means music without voices (for "non_vocal", I only tested with piano audio). However, there is still a large room of improvement for the accuracy, especially for "vocal". There are still a lot of details can be improved like gaussian filtering, different frequency transforming methods other than cqt and better parameters.
